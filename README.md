# Discourse Evolution Analisys Covid-19
Project to analyze the discourses of government entities from internet posts about Covid-19. It uses NLP techniques to do this analysis. <br>
It compares two topic modeling techniques: Discrete LDA and Topics Over Time, an extension of Discrete LDA. <br>
In this evaluation, the models were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively, in order to find out which of the two models best fits the data. At the end of the development, it was seen that each one has advantages and disadvantages in relation to the other, and it is not possible to say which is better. This implementation is intended to promote this area of research and serve as a basis for other works. <br>
